# BS Chat App

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.0.1.

## Project setup
> Installing angular
Install angular by running `npm install -g @angular/cli` command on terminal or command prompt. If you don't have npm or any package manager installed on you system you have to install it at first.

>Download tools
I like to use Visual studio code here, but we can use any dev friendly text editor. You can download the Visual studio code from [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)

>Installing packages
Open the BSChatFE project directory with VS code. Click on terminal on the top toolbar and a terminal will open on the bottom side of VS code. Run command `npm install`. This will take some time to install the necessary packages and libraries.

## Development server

After the package has been installed run `npm start` or `ng serve` to run the project on a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` on your browser. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
